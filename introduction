What is Dart?
Dart is an open-source, object-oriented programming language developed by Google. It is mainly used for building mobile, web, and desktop applications. Dart is the primary language for Flutter, a popular UI framework for creating cross-platform applications.

Features of Dart
Object-Oriented – Supports classes, interfaces, and mixins.
Compiled & Interpreted – Can be compiled to native code for better performance or run in a VM for development.
Strong Typing – Supports both static and dynamic typing.
Garbage Collection – Automatic memory management.
Asynchronous Programming – Uses async and await for non-blocking code execution.
Hot Reload – Allows fast updates in Flutter development.
Platform Independence – Runs on multiple platforms (mobile, web, desktop).
Null Safety – Helps prevent null reference errors.
Rich Standard Library – Provides built-in support for collections, async, and more.
Advantages of Dart
✅ Fast Development – Hot reload makes it easier to test and iterate code.
✅ High Performance – Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation improves execution speed.
✅ Cross-Platform – Write code once and run it on multiple platforms.
✅ Rich UI Development – Works seamlessly with Flutter to create beautiful UI.
✅ Easy to Learn – Syntax is simple and similar to JavaScript and Java.
✅ Strong Community & Google Support – Actively maintained by Google.

Disadvantages of Dart
❌ Limited Adoption – Not as popular as JavaScript, Python, or Java.
❌ Large App Size – Flutter apps built with Dart tend to be larger in size.
❌ Limited Third-Party Libraries – Fewer libraries compared to JavaScript or Python.
❌ Less Support for Native Features – May require additional plugins for full native functionality.
